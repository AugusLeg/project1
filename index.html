Around 370, swarms of Huns took over much of Western Europe, conquering Germanic tribes and scaring others out of their growing territory. But does this nomadic people deserve its outsized reputation?
    </p>
    
    <p>
That question is hard to answer. The Huns “remain deeply mysterious,” writes historian Peter Heather, in part due to their lack of written history and their obscure origins. The nomadic people are thought to have come from what is now Kazakhstan, and swept across the eastern steppes after about 350 A.D. Some scholars think they were a Turkic tribe descended from the Xiongnu, a group of pastoral nomads who unified much of Asia during the late third and early second centuries B.C.
    </p>
<p>
  As the Huns moved along the Black Sea, they attacked those in their path. These people - Vandals, Visigoths, Goths and other groups - fled toward Rome. These migrations destabilized the Roman Empire and helped the Huns gain a murderous reputation.
    </p>
<p>
  Their most notorious leader, Attila the Hun, solidified that perception. Between 440 and 453 A.D., he led Hunnic hordes throughout much of Europe, including Gaul (modern-day France). Along the way he pillaged with abandon, gaining a reputation in historical accounts as a “Scourge of God” whose people perpetrated unspeakable acts of terror whenever they entered new territory. 
    </p>
      </div>
  <div class="five columns">
<p>
  But the archaeological record tells a different story. In 2017, for example, archaeologist Susanne Hakenbeck analyzed Hunnic bones buried in Pannonia, a former Roman region in what is now Hungary. Isotopic analysis revealed that Huns coexisted and conducted cultural exchange with Romans. Hunnic history “wasn’t necessarily just a story of conflict, but more a story of cross-border exchanges, cross-border adaptability,” Hakenbeck told the Washington Post in 2017.
    </p>
    
<p>
  Attila the Hun never invaded Rome itself, and his empire fell apart around 469 A.D. Nonetheless, his people’s barbaric reputation has endured. Greek historian Jordanes, writing in the sixth century A.D., called them a “treacherous tribe,” and they were widely associated with the fall of the Roman Empire. However, modern historians believe they played a less direct role in its dissolution, and that the empire’s inherent instability left it vulnerable to barbarian invasion.
    </p>
    
<p>
  The fearsome reputation of the Huns has played a part in modern conflict as well. After German emperor Wilhelm II encouraged his soldiers to be as merciless as the Huns during a speech in 1900, the term became associated with Germany. During World War I, “Hun” was widely used as an epithet toward Germans. Today, it still implies a barbaric people - but one that may have had much less might than their name might imply.

    <h2>Who were the Vikings</h2>
    
   <div class="five columns">   
<p>
Notorious for their violent raids, the Vikings influenced everything from language to tax systems throughout much of the world.
</p>
<p>
Helmets with horns. Massive ships. Brutal warfare. When it comes to the Vikings - Scandinavian seafarers known for their far - flung raids on other people - stereotypes and misconceptions abound. Who were these nautical explorers, really, and should they even be called Vikings?
</p>
<p>
That’s a controversial concept. The word was initially used to describe not a people, but rather the activity of exploring, piracy, or raiding. After being revived in English in the 19th century, the term “Viking” came to represent the Scandinavian seafarers who ventured beyond their borders to explore, raid, and ultimately settle between about 790 and 1100 A.D.
</p>
<p>
Those raiding journeys were expansive and often violent. Beginning in the 790s, Scandinavian pirates sailed south and attacked largely defenseless monasteries in England, Scotland, and Ireland. It heralded the beginning of a new era of Swedish, Norse, and Danish exploration. The reasons behind the incursions are still debated by historians, but may have related to a lack of marriageable women, a desire for slave labor, or a desire to expand trade networks.
</p>
<h3>
International raiders
</h3>
<p>
Starting in 865, the Vikings began a massive invasion of England. Known as the “Great Heathen Army,” the pagan soldiers attacked and took over three of England's four Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Though referred to in military terms at the time, the raiders also included traders, women, and children. The remaining unconquered kingdom, Wessex, escaped Viking rule, but engaged in years of fighting. Eventually the Danelaw, the lands taken over by Danish Vikings, extended across the entire northeastern portion of England. (Norwegians settled in Scotland.)

<p>
England wasn’t the only place where the Vikings made themselves known: they sailed as far south as North Africa, as far west as Canada, and into the Middle East, Russia, France, and Spain (see a map). Along the way, Vikings settled, intermixed with the people they conquered, and influenced everything from language to warfare.
</p>
<p>
Between the 9th and 11th centuries A.D., Vikings conducted more raids. But the Second Viking Age, as it was known, involved a new form of power: money. Vikings demanded payment, later known as “danegeld,” in exchange for not conducting raids and maintaining peace. England’s taxation system was founded on this method of extortion.
</p>
<h3>
Waning influence
</h3>
<p>
By about 1100, Viking dominance diminished. Political power consolidated as scattered chiefdoms gave way to Scandinavian kingdoms and legal institutions. Vikings' targets had invested in fortifications and learned to defend themselves. The Battle of Hastings brought the end of Viking rule in England in 1066, and the adoption of Christianity within Scandinavia slowed the raids.
</p>
<p>
Though popular culture continues to depict Vikings as wearing horned helmets (they didn’t) and drinking from skulls (also a myth), their peaceful trading and cultural sharing belies the violent legend. The Vikings’ cultural power and contributions to the communities in which they settled were just as potent as their ability to sail and pillage.

Who were the Moors?
</h2>
         <a target="_blank" title="Unknown author / Public domain" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Castillia.jpg"><img class="u-full-width" alt="Castillia" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Castillia.jpg"></a>
         <div class="five columns">
    
<p>
If the term “Moor” seems familiar but confusing, there’s a reason: Though the term can be found throughout literature, art, and history books, it does not actually describe a specific ethnicity or race. Instead, the concept of Moors has been used to describe alternatively the reign of Muslims in Spain, Europeans of African descent, and others for centuries.
</p>
<p>
Derived from the Latin word “Maurus,” the term was originally used to describe Berbers and other people from the ancient Roman province of Mauretania in what is now North Africa. Over time, it was increasingly applied to Muslims living in Europe. Beginning in the Renaissance, “Moor” and “blackamoor” were also used to describe any person with dark skin.
</p>
<p>
In A.D. 711, a group of North African Muslims led by the Berber general, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, captured the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain and Portugal). Known as al-Andalus, the territory became a prosperous cultural and economic center where education and the arts and sciences flourished.
</p>
     
<p>
Over time, the strength of the Muslim state diminished, creating inroads for Christians who resented Moorish rule. For centuries, Christian groups challenged Muslim territorial dominance in al-Andalus and slowly expanded their territory. This culminated in 1492, when Catholic monarchs Ferdinand II and Isabella I won the Granada War and completed Spain’s conquest of the Iberian Peninsula. Eventually, the Moors were expelled from Spain.
</p>
    </div>
<div class="five columns">
  <p>
By then, the idea of Moors had spread across Western Europe. “Moor” came to mean anyone who was Muslim or had dark skin; occasionally, Europeans would distinguish between “blackamoors” and “white Moors.”
</p>
<p>
One of the most famous mentions of Moors is in Shakespeare’s play The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice. Its titular character is a Moor who serves as a general in the Venetian army. (In Shakespeare’s time, the port city of Venice was ethnically diverse, and the Moors represented a growing interchange between Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Africa.) Despite his military prowess, Othello is also portrayed as exotic, hypersexual, and untrustworthy - “a lascivious Moor” who secretly marries a white woman - reflecting historic stereotypes of black people.
</p>
<p>
More recently, the term has been coopted by the sovereign citizen movement in the United States. Members of Moorish sovereign citizen groups claim they are descended from Moors who predated white settlers in North America, and that they are part of a sovereign nation and not subject to U.S. laws. It’s proof of the ongoing allure of “Moor” as a seemingly legitimate ethnic designation - even though its meaning has never been clear.
